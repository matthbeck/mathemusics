  <title>Tones, frequencies, and <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> </title>
  <p>
    We need a bit of musical language to get started.
    (A useful index of sorts on all kinds of musical and acoustic terms is <url href="https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/index.html" visual="here"/>; it is based on <xref ref="truax"/>.)
  </p>
  <subsection>
    <title>A few musical concepts</title>
  <p>
    A single sound played on some musical instrument (or sung by a human voice) is a <term>tone</term>.
    If you know some physics/acoustics, then you know each tone has a sound wave, which in turn has a
<term>(fundamental) frequency</term>, measured in hertz (Hz). E.g., a concert A has 440 Hz.
    When musicians give a tone a name (we just named a concert A, also known as A4), we call this the <term>pitch</term> of the tone. A <term>scale</term> is an ordering of a system of pitches.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <term>interval</term> consists of two tones/pitches. If the frequencies of the two tones have the
ratio 2:1, we call the interval an <term>octave</term>. International pitch notation uses the same letter
for two pitches that are an octave apart; e.g., A3 (at 220 Hz) is an octave below A4, whereas A5 (at
880 Hz) is an octave above A4. The set of all pitches that differ by octaves is called a <term>pitch
class</term> and can be denoted by a single letter (e.g., A). Viewed mathematically, pitch classes are
wonderful examples of equivalence classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Frequencies behave multiplicatively; e.g., moving up an octave means doubling the frequency of
the tone, moving down an octave means halving it. We can also move in between octaves: e.g., we can
multiply the frequency of a given tone by <m>\frac 3 2</m> to reach another tone;<fn>This creates an
interval of what musicians call a <em>perfect fifth</em></fn> to reach the octave above the original tone, we can multiply
the frequency again by <m>\frac 4 3</m>.<fn>The second thus created interval is a <em>perfect
forth</em>.</fn>
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="sec_scales"/>, we will discuss how one constructs actual musical scales;
for now we want to pre-process this with a (simple) abstract mathematical model.
We will make the crucial assumption that a scale has a periodic character governed by octaves, in the
sense that, if we know the frequencies of the tones within a given octave, the corresponding tones in
the following octave will have exactly double those frequencies. Thus, if a scale features
<m>n</m> tones within one octave, we can compute the frequency of any tone in the scale if we know the
frequencies of these <m>n</m> tones.

  <p>
    As an example, consider the black keys on a piano (see <xref ref="fig_pianokeys">Figure</xref>);
they form an instance of what's known as a <em>pentatonic scale</em>. Start at your favorite
F<m>\sharp</m>, and five black keys later you will end up at another F<m>\sharp</m>, one octave
higher. So for a pentatonic scale, <m>n = 5</m> and the frequencies of any consecutive
F<m>\sharp</m>, G<m>\sharp</m>, A<m>\sharp</m>, C<m>\sharp</m>, and D<m>\sharp</m> determine the
frequency of the whole scale.
  </p>
  <p>
Similarly, the white keys form an example of a <em>heptatonic scale</em>, with <m>n = 7</m>.
As a final example, all keys of the piano form the <em>chromatic scale</em>, with <m>n = 12</m>.
A musician will note a crucial difference between the first two scales and the chromatic one: the
latter consists entirely of semitone steps, whereas the two former scales have steps consisting of
some semitones, some whole tones, and some minor thirds. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a short step to model, say,
    a twelve-note scale as <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>
    ,
    and so these mathematical aspects of chords are independent of the actual frequency ratios of the scale.

    <title>The harmonic spectrum</title>
  <p>
    A tone actually comes with many frequencies: its fundamental frequency (which determines the
pitch of the tone) and its <term>harmonic spectrum</term>, consisting of positive integer multiple of the
fundamental frequency. E.g., the first and second harmonic of a given tone will form an octave.
The relative intensity of these harmonics are, for the most part, responsible
for the tone quality/timbre; i.e., different instruments will feature different harmonic spectra.<fn>Instruments also feature resonating frequencies that are not integer multiples of the fundamental; these are called <term>partials</term>. They play a large role, e.g., in bells and percussion instruments.</fn>
