  <title>Tone, Pitch, Frequency, and <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> </title>
  <p>
    A single sound played on some musical instrument is a <em>tone</em>.
    If you know some physics/acoustics, then you know each tone has a sound wave, which in turn has a
(fundamental) <em>frequency</em>, measured in hertz (Hz). E.g., a concert A has 440 Hz.
    When musicians give a tone a name (we just named a concert A), we call this the <em>pitch</em>. A
<em>scale</em> is an ordering of a system of pitches.
    (A useful index of sorts on all kinds of musical and acoustic terms is <url href="https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/index.html" visual="here"/>; it is based on <xref ref="truax"/>.)

    An actual tone has, in fact, many frequencies: its fundamental frequency (which determines the
pitch of the tone) and its <em>harmonic spectrum</em>, consisting of positive integer multiple of the
fundamental frequency. The relative intensity of these harmonics are, for the most part, responsible
for the tone quality; e.g., different instruments will have different harmonic spectra. (Instruments
also feature resonating frequencies that are not integer multiples of the fundamental; these are
called <em>partials</em>. They play a large role, e.g., in bells and percussion instruments.)

    It is a short step to model, say,
    a twelve-note scale as <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>
    (see <xref ref="fig_pianokeys">Figure</xref>),
    and so these mathematical aspects of chords are independent of the actual frequency ratios of the scale.
