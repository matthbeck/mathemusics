  <title>Tones, frequencies, and <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> </title>
  <p>
    We need a bit of musical language to get started.
    (A useful index of sorts on all kinds of musical and acoustic terms is <url href="https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/index.html" visual="here"/>; it is based on <xref ref="truax"/>.)
  </p>
  <subsection>
    <title>A few musical concepts</title>
  <p>
    A single sound played on some musical instrument (or sung by a human voice) is a <term>tone</term>.
    If you know some physics/acoustics, then you know each tone has a sound wave, which in turn has a
<term>(fundamental) frequency</term>, measured in hertz (Hz). E.g., a concert A has 440 Hz.
    When musicians give a tone a name (we just named a concert A, also known as A4), we call this the <term>pitch</term> of the tone. A <term>scale</term> is an ordering of a system of pitches.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <term>interval</term> consists of two tones/pitches. If the frequencies of the two tones have the
ratio 2:1, we call the interval an <term>octave</term>. International pitch notation uses the same letter
for two pitches that are an octave apart; e.g., A3 (at 220 Hz) is an octave below A4, whereas A5 (at
880 Hz) is an octave above A4. The set of all pitches that differ by octaves is called a <term>pitch
class</term> and can be denoted by a single letter (e.g., A). Viewed mathematically, pitch classes are
wonderful examples of equivalence classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Frequencies behave multiplicatively; e.g., moving up an octave means doubling the frequency of
the tone, moving down an octave means halving it. We can also move in between octaves: e.g., we can
multiply the frequency of a given tone by <m>\frac 3 2</m> to reach another tone;<fn>This creates an
interval of what musicians call a <em>perfect fifth</em></fn> to reach the octave above the original tone, we can multiply
the frequency again by <m>\frac 4 3</m>.<fn>The second thus created interval is a <em>perfect
forth</em>.</fn>
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="sec_scales"/>, we will discuss how one constructs actual musical scales;
for now we want to pre-process this with a (simple) abstract mathematical model.
We will make the crucial assumption that a scale has a periodic character governed by octaves, in the
sense that, if we know the frequencies of the tones within a given octave, the corresponding tones in
the following octave will have exactly double those frequencies. Thus, if a scale features
<m>n</m> tones within one octave, we can compute the frequency of any tone in the scale if we know the
frequencies of these <m>n</m> tones.

  <p>
    As an example, the black keys on a piano (see <xref ref="fig_pianokeys">Figure</xref>)
form an instance of what's known as a <em>pentatonic scale</em>. Start at your favorite
F<m>\sharp</m>, and five black keys later you will end up at another F<m>\sharp</m>, one octave
higher. So here <m>n = 5</m> and the frequencies of any consecutive
F<m>\sharp</m>, G<m>\sharp</m>, A<m>\sharp</m>, C<m>\sharp</m>, and D<m>\sharp</m> determine the
frequency of the whole scale.
Similarly, the white keys form an example of a <em>heptatonic scale</em>, with <m>n = 7</m>.
As a final example, all keys of the piano form the <em>chromatic scale</em>, with <m>n = 12</m>.
A musician will note a crucial difference between the first two scales and the chromatic one: the
latter consists entirely of semitone steps, whereas the two former scales have steps consisting of
some semitones, some whole tones, and some minor thirds. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a short step to model a scale with <m>n</m> notes in an octave with
    <m>\ZZ_{ n } := \{ 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \}</m> as a labeling of a base scale (such as
F<m>\sharp</m>, G<m>\sharp</m>, A<m>\sharp</m>, C<m>\sharp</m>, and D<m>\sharp</m> in our pentatonic
example), the assigned frequencies of which will determine those of the entire scale.

    <title>Intervals</title>
    <p>
      From now one, we will work with a chromatic scale, with 12 tones in an octave. We model it as
      <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, with C as the base note; this is an arbitrary starting point, and so in some
sense, we may ignore the second row in <xref ref="tab_z12scale">Table</xref> and simply think of
tones (rather, their pitch classes) as elements in <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>.

literally. Again, we assign <m>7</m> the frequency <m>\frac 3 2</m>. Since <m>7 + 7 = 2 \in \ZZ_{ 12
}</m>, the frequency assigned to <m>2</m> (the <term>whole tone</term>) needs to be <m>(\frac 3 2)^2</m>
scaled down by an octave, that is, <m>\frac 9 8</m>.
Moving up by another perfect fifth, we reach <m>2 + 7 = 9 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>major
sixth</term>, with frequency <m>\frac 9 8 \cdot \frac 3 2 = \frac{ 27 }{ 16 }</m>.
The next step <m>9 + 7 = 4 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> again needs its frequency scaled down by an octave,
i.e., <m>\frac{ 27 }{ 16 } \cdot \frac 3 2 \cdot \frac 1 2 = \frac{ 81 }{ 64 }</m>, the frequency for the
<term>major third</term>.
Stepping up one more fifth reaches <m>4 + 7 = 11 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>major seventh</term>,
with frequency <m>\frac{ 81 }{ 64 } \cdot \frac 3 2 = \frac{ 243 }{ 128 }</m>. One more step yields
<m>11 + 7 = 6 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>tritone</term>, with frequency <m>\frac{ 243 }{ 128 } \cdot
\frac 3 2 \cdot \frac 1 2 = \frac{ 729 }{ 512 }</m> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we make use of the fact that <m>5 = -7 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>perfect forth</term>,
which thus gets assigned the frequency <m>\frac 4 3</m> (because <m>\frac 3 2 \cdot \frac 4 3 =
2</m>). From here we now move <em>down</em> a fifth to <m>5 - 7 = 10 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the
<term>minor seventh</term>, whose frequency needs to moved up an octave: <m>\frac 4 3 \cdot \frac 2 3
\cdot 2 = \frac{ 16 }{ 9 }</m>. The next fifth down reaches <m>10 - 7 = 3 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the
<term>minor third</term>, with frequency <m>\frac{ 16 }{ 9 } \cdot \frac 2 3 = \frac{ 32 }{ 27 }</m>.
One more step yield <m>3 - 7 = 8 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>minor sixth</term>, with frequency
<m>\frac{ 32 }{ 27 } \cdot \frac 2 3 \cdot 2 = \frac{ 128 }{ 81 }</m>. Finally, <m>8 - 7 = 1  \in
\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> gives the <term>semitone</term> with frequency <m>\frac{ 128 }{ 81 } \cdot \frac 2 3 =
\frac{ 256 }{ 243 }</m>. 
The resulting scale is summarized in .

    <title>The harmonic spectrum</title>
  <p>
    A tone actually comes with many frequencies: its fundamental frequency (which determines the
pitch of the tone) and its <term>harmonic spectrum</term>, consisting of positive integer multiple of the
fundamental frequency. E.g., the first and second harmonic of a given tone will form an octave.
The relative intensity of these harmonics are, for the most part, responsible
for the tone quality/timbre; i.e., different instruments will feature different harmonic spectra.<fn>Instruments also feature resonating frequencies that are not integer multiples of the fundamental; these are called <term>partials</term>. They play a large role, e.g., in bells and percussion instruments.</fn>
