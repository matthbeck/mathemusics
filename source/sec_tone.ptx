  <title>Tone, Pitch, Frequency, and <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> </title>

    We need a bit of musical language to get started.
    (A useful index of sorts on all kinds of musical and acoustic terms is <url href="https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/index.html" visual="here"/>; it is based on <xref ref="truax"/>.)

    A single sound played on some musical instrument is a <em>tone</em>.
    If you know some physics/acoustics, then you know each tone has a sound wave, which in turn has a
<em>(fundamental) frequency</em>, measured in hertz (Hz). E.g., a concert A has 440 Hz.
    When musicians give a tone a name (we just named a concert A, also known as A4), we call this the <em>pitch</em> of the tone. A <em>scale</em> is an ordering of a system of pitches.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <em>interval</em> consists of two tones/pitches. If the frequencies of the two tones have the
ratio 2:1, we call the interval an <em>octave</em>. International pitch notation uses the same letter
for two pitches that are an octave apart; e.g., A3 (at 220 Hz) is an octave below A4, whereas A5 (at
880 Hz) is an octave above A4. The set of all pitches that differ by octaves is called a <em>pitch
class</em> and can be denoted by a single letter (e.g., A). Pitch classes are, viewed mathematically,
equivalence classes.

  <p>
    It is a short step to model, say,
    a twelve-note scale as <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>
    (see <xref ref="fig_pianokeys">Figure</xref>),
    and so these mathematical aspects of chords are independent of the actual frequency ratios of the scale.

    A tone actually comes with many frequencies: its fundamental frequency (which determines the
pitch of the tone) and its <em>harmonic spectrum</em>, consisting of positive integer multiple of the
fundamental frequency. E.g., the first and second harmonic of a given tone will form an octave.
The relative intensity of these harmonics are, for the most part, responsible
for the tone quality; e.g., different instruments will have different harmonic spectra. (Instruments
also feature resonating frequencies that are not integer multiples of the fundamental; these are
called <em>partials</em>. They play a large role, e.g., in bells and percussion instruments.)
