  <title>Scales</title>
  <p>
    The mathematics of musical scales and, by extension,
    intervals between two notes has been extensively studied
    (see, e.g.,<nbsp/><xref ref="cladertwelvetones,schettlerxenharmonic"/> for two recent papers).
    Here we present various constructions; all are for a scale in 12 notes in an octave (with
frequency ration 2:1) and the existence of a <term>perfect fifth</term> with frequency ratio 3:2. In
our simple mathematical model, the perfect fifth corresponds to the number <m>7</m> in <m>\ZZ_{ 12
}</m>. 
  </p>
  <subsection>
    <title>The Pythagorean Scale</title>
    <p>
      Our first construction takes the fact that <m>7</m> generates <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> quite
literally. Again, we assign <m>7</m> the frequency <m>\frac 3 2</m>. Since <m>7 + 7 = 2 \in \ZZ_{ 12
}</m>, the frequency assigned to <m>2</m> (the <term>whole tone</term>) needs to be <m>(\frac 3 2)^2</m>
scaled down by an octave, that is, <m>\frac 9 8</m>.
Moving up by another perfect fifth, we reach <m>2 + 7 = 9 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>major
sixth</term>, with frequency <m>\frac 9 8 \cdot \frac 3 2 = \frac{ 27 }{ 16 }</m>.
The next step <m>9 + 7 = 4 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> again needs its frequency scaled down by an octave,
i.e., <m>\frac{ 27 }{ 16 } \cdot \frac 3 2 \cdot 1 2 = \frac{ 81 }{ 64 }</m>, the frequency for the
<term>major third</term>.
Stepping up one more fifth reaches <m>4 + 7 = 11 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>major seventh</term>,
with frequency <m>\frac{ 81 }{ 64 } \cdot \frac 3 2 = \frac{ 243 }{ 128 }</m>. One more step yields
<m>11 + 7 = 6 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>triad</term>, with frequency <m>\frac{ 243 }{ 128 } \cdot
3 2 \cdot \frac 1 2 = \frac{ 729 }{ 512 }</m> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we make use of the fact that <m>5 = -7 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>perfect forth</term>,
which thus gets assigned the frequency <m>\frac 4 3</m> (because <m>\frac 3 2 \cdot \frac 4 3 =
2</m>). From here we now move <em>down</em> a fifth to <m>5 - 7 = 10 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the
<term>minor seventh</term>, whose frequency needs to moved up an octave: <m>\frac 4 3 \cdot \frac 2 3
\cdot 2 = \frac{ 16 }{ 9 }</m>. The next fifth down reaches <m>10 - 7 = 3 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the
<term>minor third</term>, with frequency <m>\frac{ 16 }{ 9 } \cdot \frac 2 3 = \frac{ 32 }{ 27 }</m>.
One more step yield <m>3 - 7 = 8 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the <term>minor sixth</term>, with frequency
<m>\frac{ 32 }{ 27 } \cdot \frac 2 3 \cdot 2 = \frac{ 128 }{ 81 }</m>. Finally, <m>8 - 7 = 1  \in
\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> gives the <term>semitone</term> with frequency <m>\frac{ 128 }{ 81 } \cdot \frac 2 3 =
\frac{ 256 }{ 243 }</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, we can see the frequency problem of the circle of fifths in action: the next
step going down a fifth reaches <m>1 - 7 = 6 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the triad, which we already reached
by moving up by five fifths. However, going down would assign the frequency <m>\frac{ 256 }{ 243 }
\cdot 2 3 \cdot 2 = \frac{ 1024 }{ 729 }</m>, which differs from <m>\frac{ 729 }{ 512 }</m> (ever so
slightly: the difference is about 0.02).

    A key feature of an interval is the frequency ratio between the two notes.
    Vastly simplified
    (and one has to be careful, for various reasons),
    our ears seem to prefer simple ratios,
    such as <m>2 \rat 1</m> (octave), <m>3 \rat 2</m>
    (perfect fifth),
    <m>4 \rat 3</m>
    (perfect forth),
    etc.
    Next we address the (decision) problem of assigning interval fractions.
    To illustrate the subtleties involved,
    it is helpful to have a sample scale to follow along with;
    we use one of the most common just scales given in <xref ref="tab_classicjustscale">Table</xref>,
    due to Johannes Kepler and known as
    <em>Kepler's Monochord No.<nbsp/>2</em>,
    transposed down a fifth <xref ref="barbour"/>;<fn>
    In its most restrictive definition,
    a \Def{just scale} is one with frequency ratios only involving the primes 2, 3, and 5.
    Kepler's just scale is based on a ratio
    <m>4 \rat 5 \rat 6</m> for each major chord (C-E-G, F-A-C, and G-B-D);
    this is precisely the ratio in which the major chord appears within the harmonic spectrum of a tone.
    Minor third and minor seventh follow then by symmetry,
    and the ratio for F\sh is the product of the ratios for a major third and a whole tone.
    </fn> the following section will discuss analogous results for various other scales
    (see also \url{https://brefeld.hier-im-netz.de/konsonanz.html}).

    The inversion equivalence (b) dictates that the interval fraction of a given interval in a chord and that of its complementary interval are equal.
    For example,
    the first F-major chord in <xref ref="fig_inversions">Figure</xref>
    features a perfect forth between C and F, where the next inversion gives a perfect fifth between these two notes
    (once more, because we do not distinguish between octaves).
    Thus the respective interval fractions,
    i.e., <m>h_5</m> and <m>h_7</m>, must be equal.
    Based on <xref ref="tab_classicjustscale">Table</xref>,
    the two possible choices for <m>h_5 = h_7</m> are
    <m>\frac 4 3</m> and <m>\frac 3 2</m>;
    we give preference to the frequency ratio whose sum of numerator and denominator is smaller.
    Thus in this case, <m>h_5 = h_7 = \frac 3 2</m>.
    More generally, we must have <m>h_j = h_{ 12-j }</m>.
    (This mirrors the fact that in
    <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> there are only six meaningful nonzero distances.)
    Our choice of preference results in the interval fractions in <xref ref="tab_classicjustscaleintfractions">Table</xref>.

    We are now all set to compute the weight of a given triad;
    again, it equals the sum of all numerators and denominators appearing in each interval fraction that we can detect in the triad.<fn>
    Birkhoff<nbsp/><xref ref="birkhoffaestheticmeasure"/> conceptualized a notion of
    <em>aesthetic measure</em> of a chord,
    though it is arguable much less refined.
    </fn> For example,
    the major triad C-E-G features a perfect fifth,
    a major third, and a minor third;
    thus its weight equals <m>5 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 22</m>,
    summing the numerators and denominators appearing in <m>h_3</m>,
    <m>h_4</m>, and <m>h_7</m>.
    Naturally, this number depends only on the distances between the base note and the other two notes,
    in this case 4 and 7;
    we will record this triad as the pair <m>(4,7)</m>.
    <xref ref="table_classicjustscaleprimecomplexity">Table</xref>
    shows the weights for all twelve equivalence classes:
    the first row gives the differences <m>(a,b)</m> to the base note for one representative of the equivalence class,
    the second row sums the numerators and denominators appearing in <m>h_a</m>,
    <m>h_b</m>, and <m>h_{ b-a }</m>.

    The weight gives a
    (very rough)
    measure of a chord.
    Indeed, the
    <q>lightest</q>
    chord family <m>(3,7)</m> contains major and minor triads.
    The next three chord families,
    with weights 27 and 30, are <m>(2,7)</m>
    (corresponding to a set of lovely chords),
    <m>(4,8)</m>
    (corresponding to the tritone),
    and <m>(2,5)</m>
    (another lovely chord family).
    The respective chords are illustrated in <xref ref="fig_classicwinners">Figure</xref>.

    <title>Why 12?</title>
    <p>
      Partial fractions turn out to be useful also when constructing a scale from first principles.
Let's say we want to come up with a scale with <m>n</m> tones per octave, and we'd like to have a
good approximation of the frequency ratio <m>\frac 3 2</m> for the perfect fifth. If you think about
the construction above, this translates to finding a "good" fraction <m>\frac a b</m> in the sense
that <m>2^{ \frac a b }</m> is reasonably close to <m>\frac 3 2</m><mdash/>in other words, we want to have a good rational approximation of <m>\log_2(\frac 3 2)</m>. The continued fraction of this number
equals <m>[0; 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 23, 2, 2, 1, \dots]</m>, which gives as first approximations
      <men xml:id="firstapprox">
        \frac 1 2, \ \frac 2 3, \ \frac 3 5, \ \frac 4 7, \ \frac 7 {12}, \ \frac{ 24 }{ 41 }, \ \frac{ 31 }{ 53 }, \ \dots 
      </men>
      This suggests that there are scales with 2, 3 , 5, 7, 12, 41, 53, etc. tones in an octave that
contain a reasonably good perfect fifth. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Scales with 2 or 3 tones are not that exciting, but any musician will know a pentatonic and a heptatonic scale: you can hear examples by playing only the black, resp. white,` keys on a piano. These scales are not anywhere close to equally tuned, but those exist also: there is an ancient 5-tone scale tuning system called <em>slendro</em> used in gamelan instruments and a 7-tone scale tuning used in traditional Siamese music <xref ref="helmholtz"/>. The next numerator in <xref ref="firstapprox"/> is 12, and it is one indication why the 12-tone scale that is prevalent today is mathematically natural.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might ask, what about 41- or 53-tone scales? They exist: e.g., there is the xenharmonic
<em>garibaldi</em> temperament (using 41 tones) and a <em>generalized keyboard hamonium</em> with 53 notes to an octave constructed in 1876 by Robert Boranquet <xref ref="helmholtz"/>.
