  <title>Scales</title>
  <p>
    The mathematics of musical scales and, by extension,
    intervals between two notes has been extensively studied
    (see, e.g.,<nbsp/><xref ref="cladertwelvetones,schettlerxenharmonic"/> for two recent papers).
    Here we present various constructions; all are for a scale in 12 notes in an octave (with
frequency ratio <m>\frac 2 1</m>) and the existence of a (perfect) fifth with frequency ratio
<m>\frac 3 2</m>. In our simple mathematical model, the fifth corresponds to the number <m>7</m> in<nbsp/><m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>. 
  </p>
  <subsection>
    <title>The Pythagorean scale</title>
    <p>
      Our first construction takes the fact that <m>7</m>, corresponding to the fifth, generates <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> quite literally. Again, we assign <m>7</m> the frequency <m>\frac 3 2</m>. Since <m>7 + 7 = 2 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the frequency assigned to <m>2</m> (the whole tone) needs to be <m>(\frac 3 2)^2</m> scaled down by an octave, that is, <m>\frac 9 8</m>.
Moving up by another perfect fifth, we reach <m>2 + 7 = 9 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> (the major sixth), with frequency <m>\frac 9 8 \cdot \frac 3 2 = \frac{ 27 }{ 16 }</m>.
The next step <m>9 + 7 = 4 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> again needs its frequency scaled down by an octave,
i.e., <m>\frac{ 27 }{ 16 } \cdot \frac 3 2 \cdot \frac 1 2 = \frac{ 81 }{ 64 }</m>, the frequency for the major third.
Stepping up one more fifth reaches <m>4 + 7 = 11 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> (the major seventh),
with frequency <m>\frac{ 81 }{ 64 } \cdot \frac 3 2 = \frac{ 243 }{ 128 }</m>. One more step yields
<m>11 + 7 = 6 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> (the tritone), with frequency <m>\frac{ 243 }{ 128 } \cdot
\frac 3 2 \cdot \frac 1 2 = \frac{ 729 }{ 512 }</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we make use of the fact that <m>5 = -7 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> (the forth),
which thus gets assigned the frequency <m>\frac 4 3</m> (because <m>\frac 3 2 \cdot \frac 4 3 =
2</m>). From here we now move <em>down</em> a fifth to <m>5 - 7 = 10 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> (the
minor seventh), whose frequency needs to be moved up an octave: <m>\frac 4 3 \cdot \frac 2 3
\cdot 2 = \frac{ 16 }{ 9 }</m>. The next fifth down reaches <m>10 - 7 = 3 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> (the
minor third), with frequency <m>\frac{ 16 }{ 9 } \cdot \frac 2 3 = \frac{ 32 }{ 27 }</m>.
One more step yields <m>3 - 7 = 8 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m> (the minor sixth), with frequency
<m>\frac{ 32 }{ 27 } \cdot \frac 2 3 \cdot 2 = \frac{ 128 }{ 81 }</m>. Finally, <m>8 - 7 = 1  \in
\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> gives the semitone with frequency <m>\frac{ 128 }{ 81 } \cdot \frac 2 3 =
\frac{ 256 }{ 243 }</m>. 
The resulting scale is summarized in <xref ref="tab_pythagoraenscale">Table</xref>.

      At this point, we can see the number theory problem of the circle of fifths from <xref ref="subsec_numbtheoryproblem">Section</xref> in action: the next
step going down a fifth reaches <m>1 - 7 = 6 \in \ZZ_{ 12 }</m>, the tritone, which we already reached
by moving up by six fifths. However, going down would assign the frequency <m>\frac{ 256 }{ 243 }
\cdot \frac 2 3 \cdot 2 = \frac{ 1024 }{ 729 }</m>, which differs from <m>\frac{ 729 }{ 512 }</m> ever so slightly:

    <title>Just scales</title>
    <p>
      It is not hard to notice that the frequency ratios in <xref
ref="tab_pythagoraenscale">Table</xref> contain only powers of <m>2</m> and <m> 3 </m>; this stems from the very
construction of the Pythagorean scale, which in turn necessitates that the numerators and
denominators appearing in the frequency ratios become large rather quickly.
      Our next scale construction avoids this, essentially by also allowing a <m> 5 </m> in the prime
factorizations of the frequency values. This feature of building up frequency ratios using the primes
<m> 2 </m>, <m> 3 </m>, and <m> 5 </m> yields the most restrictive definition of a <term>just scale</term>; a more loose
definition of this term applies to any scale whose frequency ratios feature small numerators and
denominators.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="subsec_harmonicspectrum">Section</xref>, we motivated the frequency ratio
<m>\frac 3 2</m> of the fifth (corresponding to the number <m>7</m> in <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>), stemming from the 2nd and 3rd harmonics, as a starting point for
building musical scales. The pair of 3rd and 4th harmonics gives the frequency ratio <m> \frac 4
3 </m> of a forth (corresponding to <m>5</m> in <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>), which complements the fifth to an octave and thus gives no new constraints.
However, the next pair of harmonics, yielding the <q>natural</q> frequency ratio <m> \frac 5 4 </m> of a
major third (corresponding to <m>4</m> in <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>), gives rise to a second starting point of constructing a scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment in our construction, the frequency ratios for <m> 0 </m>, <m> 4 </m>, <m> 5 </m>,
and <m> 7 </m> are fixed. The next natural steps are to set the frequency ratio of <m> 9 = 5+4 \in
\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> to <m> \frac 4 3 \cdot \frac 5 4 = \frac 5 3 </m> and that of <m> 11 = 7 + 4 \in
\ZZ_{ 12 }</m> to <m> \frac 3 2 \cdot \frac 5 4 = \frac{ 15 }{ 8 }</m>.
      With the same reasoning as for the Pythagorean scale, we assign <m> 2 = 7 + 7 \in \ZZ_{ 12
}</m> the frequency ratio <m> (\frac 3 2)^2 \cdot \frac 1 2 = \frac 9 8 </m>. A musician will now
notice that we have constructed frequencies, such that the three major chords (C-E-G, F-A-C, and
G-B-D when we start our scale at C) each have frequency ratios <m> 4:5:6 </m>, which is precisely the
ratio in which the major chord appears within a harmonic spectrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frequency ratio <m> \frac{ 16 }{ 15 }</m> of <m> 1 </m> follows by symmetry if we want its
product with <m> \frac{ 15 }{ 8 }</m> (the frequency ratio of <m> 11 </m>) to be <m> 2 </m>. By the
same reasoning we assign <m> 3 </m> the frequency ratio <m> \frac 65 </m>, then <m> 8 </m> the
frequency ration <m> \frac 8 5 </m>, and <m> 10 </m> the frequency ratio <m> \frac{ 16 }{ 9 }</m>.
      What remains is the frequency ratio assigned to <m> 6 </m>, which has several ways to be
broken down in <m> \ZZ_{ 12 } </m>. Writing <m> 6 = 4+2 </m>, we choose the frequency ratio <m> \frac
5 4 \cdot \frac 9 8 = \frac{ 45 }{ 32 }</m>.
      This yields one of the most common just scales given in <xref ref="tab_classicjustscale">Table</xref>, due to Johannes Kepler and known as <em>Kepler's Monochord No.<nbsp/>2</em>, transposed down a fifth <xref ref="barbour"/>.

      As promised, the numerators and denominators appearing in this scale are on average quite a bit
smaller than the ones in <xref ref="tab_pythagoraenscale">Table</xref>. But Kepler's just scale has a
different set of disadvantages; possibly the most famous is the <em>wolf fifth</em> between D and A,
with a frequency ratio of <m> \frac 5 3 \cdot \frac 8 9 = \frac{ 40 }{ 27 }</m>, which is a bit off
from <m>\frac 3 2</m>. Indeed, the ratio of these two values is the famous <em>syntonic comma</em>
<m>\frac{ 81 }{ 80 }</m>. It shows up all over the place when one studies musical scales; one other
instance is the ratio of the frequencies of the Pyathagorean major third (<m>\frac{ 81 }{ 64 }</m>,
as featured in <xref ref="tab_pythagoraenscale">Table</xref>)
and the <q>natural</q> major third (<m> \frac 5 4 </m>) appearing in the harmonic spectrum. The difference
of a syntonic comma is noticeable even to non-musically-trained ears.

    <title>Equal-tempered scales and continued fractions</title>
    <p>
      Our next scale starts out mathematically boring: momentarily throwing out the concept of
frequency ratios that are actually fractions, we can easily construct a 12-tone scale in which each
semitone interval has exactly the same frequency ratio. Namely, we assign to each interval the
appropriate power of <m>\sqrt[12] 2</m>. The resulting scale in <xref ref="tab_equaltempscale">Table</xref> is called <term>equal tempered</term>. (A neat mathematical interplay between just and equal-temperament scales is featured in<nbsp/><xref ref="bolandhughston"/>.)

      An equal temperament is what a piano tuner attempts, so if you've ever wondered what <m>\sqrt
2</m> sounds like, play a tritone<ellipsis/>
    </p>
    <p>
      To come up with a just tuning that approximates equal temperament well, we use <em>continued
fractions</em>. This is a tried-and-trusted approach to approximating a given number <m>x</m> by
rationals:
    </p>
    <ol> 
      <li>Decompose <m>x = \lfloor x \rfloor + \{ x \}</m> into its integer and fractional parts.
        (So <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m> is the largest integer .) Let's call <m>m_0 := \lfloor x \rfloor</m> and <m>x_1 := \frac{ 1 }{ \{ x \} }</m>.</li>
      <li>Decompose <m>x_1 = \lfloor x_1 \rfloor + \{ x_1 \}</m> and call <m>m_1 := \lfloor x_1
\rfloor</m> and <m>x_2 := \frac{ 1 }{ \{ x_1 \} }</m>.</li>

    <title>Why 12?</title>
    <p>
      Continued fractions turn out to be useful also when constructing a scale from first principles.
Let's say we want to come up with a scale with <m>n</m> tones per octave, and we'd like to have a
good approximation of the frequency ratio <m>\frac 3 2</m> for the perfect fifth. If you think about
the construction above, this translates to finding a <q>good</q> fraction <m>\frac a b</m> in the sense
that <m>2^{ \frac a b }</m> is reasonably close to <m>\frac 3 2</m><mdash/>in other words, we want to have a good rational approximation of <m>\log_2(\frac 3 2)</m>. The continued fraction of this number
is as follows:
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        continued_fraction(log(3/2)/log(2))
      </input>
      <output>
        [0; 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 23, 2, 2, 1, 1, 55, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, ...]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      This yields as first approximations
      <men xml:id="firstapprox">
        \frac 1 2, \ \frac 2 3, \ \frac 3 5, \ \frac 4 7, \ \frac 7 {12}, \ \frac{ 24 }{ 41 }, \ \frac{ 31 }{ 53 }, \ \dots 
      </men>
      suggesting that there are scales with 2, 3 , 5, 7, 12, 41, 53, etc. tones in an octave that
contain a reasonably good perfect fifth. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Scales with 2 or 3 tones are not that exciting, but any musician will know a pentatonic and a
heptatonic scale: as we said earlier, you can hear examples by playing only the black, resp. white,` keys on a piano. These scales are not anywhere close to equally tuned, but those exist also: there is an ancient 5-tone scale tuning system called <em>slendro</em> used in gamelan instruments and a 7-tone scale tuning used in traditional Siamese music <xref ref="helmholtz"/>. The next numerator in <xref ref="firstapprox"/> is 12, and it is one indication why the 12-tone scale that is prevalent today is mathematically natural.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might ask, what about 41- or 53-tone scales? They exist: e.g., there is the xenharmonic
<em>garibaldi</em> temperament (using 41 tones) and a <em>generalized keyboard hamonium</em> with 53 notes to an octave constructed in 1876 by Robert Boranquet<nbsp/><xref ref="helmholtz"/>.
