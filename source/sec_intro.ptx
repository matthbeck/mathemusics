    The mathematics of musical scales and, by extension,
    intervals between two notes has been extensively studied
    (see, e.g.,<nbsp/><xref ref="cladertwelvetones,schettlerxenharmonic"/> for two recent papers).
    A key feature of an interval is the frequency ratio between the two notes.
    Vastly simplified
    (and one has to be careful, for various reasons),
    our ears seem to prefer simple ratios,
    such as <m>2 \rat 1</m> (octave), <m>3 \rat 2</m>
    (perfect fifth),
    <m>4 \rat 3</m>
    (perfect forth),
    etc.
    See, e.g.,<nbsp/><xref ref="bensonmusic,walkerdon"/> for relevant background.

    Likewise, there is much literature on the mathematics of musical chords giving,
    e.g., interesting group-theoretic connections,
    both in music theory (see,
    e.g.,<nbsp/><xref ref="morristwelvetone"/>) and algebra
    (see, e.g.,<nbsp/><xref ref="cransfioresatyendra"/>).
    These tend to concern movements in a given musical piece,
    such as transpositions and inversions.
    It is a short step to model, say,
    a twelve-note scale as <m>\ZZ_{ 12 }</m>
    (see <xref ref="fig_pianokeys">Figure</xref>),
    and so these mathematical aspects of chords are independent of the actual frequency ratios of the scale.

    But why do we perceive, say,
    a major triad as more pleasant than a chord consisting of three notes separated by two half tones?
    One could make an argument that the appreciation of chords is to a large extend culturally based.
    On the other hand, acoustics (see,
    e.g.,<nbsp/><xref ref="hallacoustics"/>) offers some explanations,
    e.g., by looking at the wave forms of chords containing a perfect forth.
    (Many piano tuners start with forths for the same reason,
    though they listen for beats in order to achieve an equal-tempered scale.)
    This gives rise to much interesting mathematics (see,
    e.g.,<nbsp/><xref ref="cubarsi"/>) and statistics
    (see, e.g.,<nbsp/><xref ref="eerolalahdelma,masinalopresti"/>).
    However, the mathemusical literature seems to contain few studies on musical chords in analogy with the afore-mentioned simple-fractions intervals.
    Our aim is to develop a mathematical model that might fill some of these gaps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Capturing a numerical value of a given chord relies on fixing a scale,
    and different scales will yield different numerics.
    We will develop a model and then try it out on different scales;
    all of them will be <em>just scales</em>,
    i.e., ones with simple<fn>
    Here <em>simple</em> refers to fractions whose numerator and denominator are not too large.
    We will have more to say about this later.
    </fn> rational frequency ratio
    (as opposed to, e.g., the equal-tempered 12-note scale,
    in which each interval has a frequency ratio equal to a power of<nbsp/><m>\sqrt[12] 2</m>;
    see <xref ref="bolandhughston"/> for a mathematical interplay between just and equal-temperament scales).
    It is this feature that will allow us to study chords from an basic mathematical perspective.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like most (all?) mathematical texts on musical subjects,
    we stress that we have no intention to capture, much less understand,
    the way different chords feel<mdash/>this is (way) beyond any arithmetic nature,
    not to mention the rich music theory that gets much closer to this issue.
    Along similar lines,
    we also clarify from the start that our model does not constitute any absolute measure:
    some features will seem arbitrary,
    and we feel that this is fine.
    The findings we offer are most definitely in the ears of the beholder,
    and we merely invite the reader to come up with their own interpretation of the mathematics behind chords presented here.
