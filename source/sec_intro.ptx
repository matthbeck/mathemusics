    <title>What?</title>
    <p>
      This collection of notes is meant for a mathematician with a musical background,<fn>
        One reason for this assumption is that our musical explanations will be kept at a minimum, the other because we find it helpful to present this material with an instrument at hand. 
      </fn>
      who would like to give a session (or two) on the connection of (elementary) mathematics and
music, aimed at college students (not necessarily math majors). Naturally, we hope that these notes
will also be useful for the students digesting the session. We do not assume that the students have a musical background, a curiosity for both math and music will suffice.

    <title>What not?</title>
    <p>
      These notes are not comprehensive in any way; for that, we recommend, e.g., <xref
ref="bensonmusic,walkerdon"/>. We merely present a few mathemusical topics that we find particularly
amusing<mdash/>a few cherries picked from a very large and very tasty cake.

    <title>Who?</title>
    <p>
      The author is a math professor with an active research program situated where 
combinatorics and number theory meet. He has played various instruments all his life and has given
mathemusical class sessions and talks on (some of) the material covered here.

    <title>Quo vadis?</title>
  <p>
    Like most (all?) mathematical texts on musical subjects,
    we stress that we have no intention to capture, much less understand,
    the way different aspects of music feel<mdash/>this is (way) beyond any arithmetic nature,
    not to mention the rich music theory that gets much closer to this issue.
    Along similar lines,
    we also clarify from the start that our models do not constitute any absolute measure:
    some features will seem arbitrary,
    and we feel that this is fine.
    The findings we offer are most definitely in the ears of the beholder,
    and we merely invite the reader to come up with their own interpretation of the mathematics behind the music presented here.
